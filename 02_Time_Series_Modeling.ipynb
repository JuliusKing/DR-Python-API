    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "This example provides an introduction to a few of DataRobot's time series modeling capabilities with a sales dataset.\n",
    "Here is a list of things we will touch on during this notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Installing the `datarobot` package\n",
    "- Configuring the client\n",
    "- Creating a project\n",
    "- Denoting known-in-advance features\n",
    "- Specifying a partitioning scheme\n",
    "- Running the automated modeling process\n",
    "- Generating predictions\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "In order to run this notebook yourself, you will need the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- This notebook. If you are viewing this in the HTML documentation bundle, you can download all of the example notebooks and supporting materials from [Downloads](../index.rst).\n",
    "- The required datasets, which is included in the same directory as this notebook.\n",
    "- A DataRobot API token. You can find your API token by logging into the DataRobot Web User Interface and looking in your `Profile`.\n",
    "- The `xlrd` Python package is needed for the pandas `read_excel` function. You can install this with `pip install xlrd`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installing the `datarobot` package\n",
    "The `datarobot` package is hosted on PyPI. You can install it via:\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip install datarobot\n",
    "```\n",
    "from the command line. Its main dependencies are `numpy` and `pandas`, which could take some time to install on a new system. We highly recommend use of virtualenvs to avoid conflicts with other dependencies in your system-wide python installation."

    "- A DataRobot endpoint - where the API server can be found\n",
    "- A DataRobot API token - a token the server uses to identify and validate the user making API requests\n",

We could manually add a column to the dataset to indicate which rows should be used for training, test, and validation, but it is straightforward to allow DataRobot to do it automatically. This dataset contains sales data from multiple individual stores so we use `multiseries_id_columns` to tell DataRobot there are actually multiple time series in this file and to indicate the column that identifies the series each row belongs to."
